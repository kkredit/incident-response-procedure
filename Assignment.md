Recently, we covered incident response in class. To apply it practically, it would be beneficial to
gain familiarity with incident response procedures. In this project, you will create an incident
response procedure for a medium sized business. Real procedures would be written by multiple
contributors, cover a variety of specific types of incidents, and be refined over time. Yours will
cover just a small number of incident types. You may use [this linked document from
CSIRT](http://csirt.org/sample_policies/incident.handling.pro.doc) as an example/template.

Consider a moderate sized company (more than 100 but less than 1000 employees), which has its own
small security team. This company prefers to deal with incidents internally. With regards to
security incidents this company has the following priorities:

- Recovery from incidents should be quick (as little downtime as possible), but it is even more
  important that repeat incidents be prevented from happening.
- The company would like to collect as much data as possible when an incident does occur, allowing
  them to take later legal actions. The company is willing to invest in extra hardware (to be used
  as replacement devices) so this can be achieved without significant effect on recovery times.

Write an incident response procedure for this company. Your procedure must provide a set of generic
instructions that are applicable to all incidents. Your procedure should also provide specific
instructions for dealing with at least two different types of incidents as well (you may choose any
except for "virus/worm" and "hacker incident", since these are in the example document).

Choose two scenarios from Appendix A of
[sp800-61](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) except for scenario 2.
Your procedure should address the scenario and questions in your two scenarios. This may overlap
with the parts of your procedure that meet the above requirement for addressing two types of
incidents. Note that you do not have to actually answer the scenario questions, but a team using
your procedure should know what actions to take if the scenario described happened, including any
aspects mentioned in the questions.
